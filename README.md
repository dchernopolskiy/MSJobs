(Not so) Extremely simple (anymore) job posting monitoring tool for Microsoft (TikTok, Greenhouse, Ashbyhq). 
Displays jobs from the https://careers.microsoft.com/ for the past 24 hours, sends a notification when a new job posting is created.
Search is performed using the job title and location.
New updates allows you to paste any greenhouse board that you want to monitor and query for the new jobs, as well as scrapes LifeAtTiktok positions.
Jobvite is in progress, Apple and Meta are, unfortunately, out of question for now, ashbyhq is currently being tested.

Current backlog: implement more ATS boards, address some performance issues, unify addition of new fetchers (so I don't have to add a new fetcher in 15 different places), but other than that it performs exactly what I needed for myself.

Compile in xcode and run. Bundled version may or may not be coming in the future.
